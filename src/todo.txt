runtracker_success_1==> print angle of target
			movement direction of the target==movement direction of the rect's center point
	>>video1->show the movement angle of the target

(rect center point's moving track success
i've made it less sensitive by 10->20)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

to develope : print direction
	      if direction is right/left >>>> don't update tracker
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

runtracker_success_2==>	print direction(left/right/still/up/down) of the target
			assume : target goes only straight forwards/backwards
				 other person goes left->right/right->left to be the target
			>>>if the movement direction of the rect's center point is left/right==>don't update
	>>video2-> show that taget doesn't change.

problem : while the other person stand still infront of the camera,
		if the target goes out of the rect, it losts it's target.

But!
We first assume that
other person goes left->right / right->left
and the target goes straight forward/backward, or stand still.
So I think this does not be the big problem.

problem : assumption can't cover all the situation.
what about if the target goes left->right / right->left..?

if the angle of the moving target changes dramatically==>>it's the other person, so don't update

problem : what if the other person's direction is same with the target's direction?
